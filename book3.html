 <h3 class="card-title">Editors Review</h3>
<p class=“card-text”>Before reading the book, I was sceptical about its relevance to the modern world as the book was first published 28 years ago (1992). I was then amazed by the examples given and some step-by-step guides for readers to practise during interactions. 
The book was originally designed for couples to improve their communication and relationships. However, it also forms a very good basis to practise 'empathy', a popular topic in diversity and inclusion. 
Whilst the landscape of technologies is changing rapidly in the last decade, the way of how people feel remains. I have no reservation to recommend this timeless book to anyone who would like to enjoy the power bought by good communications with empathy.
