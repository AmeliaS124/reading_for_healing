            <p>The first Pony Club Secrets mystery adventure by bestselling author of 'The Princess and the Foal'.
                Issie loves horses more than anything!
                And she especially loves her pony Mystic at Chevalier Point Pony Club. So when the unthinkable happens, Issie is devastated.
                Then her instructor asks her to care for Blaze, an abandoned pony, and Issie's riding skills are really put to the test. Will she tame the spirited new horse Blaze? And can Mystic somehow return to help her...

 <h5 class="card-title">Editors Review</h5>
 <p class="card-text">The Pony Club Secrets is another series for children (8-12). This book replaced the need for a horse of my own and the Pony Club friends I never quite made, although it did increase the desire for that to be how things turned out. This series contains 13 books and 4 spin-offs, a nice mix of fiction and Stacy Greggâ€™s own experiences as a horse-mad girl combine to create this elegant series which many pre-teen girls can relate to (and wish was their reality). The series tackles the difficulties of owning horses as well as navigating friendships, competitions and generally growing up all within its frame of fiction/adventure. In this first installment Issie must tackle her first gymkhana as well as trying to tame the abandoned Blaze, who might not be out of danger.  </p>
