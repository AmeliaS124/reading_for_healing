 <h5 class="card-title">Editors Review</h5>
 <p class="card-text">Goldie is the very first book in the Puppy Place series. It is about two children and their family who decide to foster a golden retriever puppy. This series is a great beginner level (Grades 2-4) book for the whole family to enjoy. It teaches children about the true expectations of having a puppy and when house training, lead training and socializing gets a bit much you can always put the book down! For me it brings great nostalgia to think about and I remember many of the lessons taught throughout this series today. This book gets you hooked on the series â€“ will Charlie and Lizzie ever get their own puppy and how many other puppies can they help? (Spoiler: there are currently 60 books in this series).  </p>
